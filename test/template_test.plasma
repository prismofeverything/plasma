okay so we are starting out clear || 

(def fi 3) |
(def ya (fun (x) (* x 3))) |
(def ikik (map ['rrr' 'uiowoyqpp i ' 'nogo deetdelowu'] ya)) |
(* 55 12) |
ikik |

|| continuing on now...  maybe I will throw in a || (* 3 5) || just for fun.  Yes?
what about Ifs, and loops?  All about control flow.

|| (if (true) then || what??  Really? || else || yes really.  ||) ||

So that almost makes sense.  The grouping should really be more clear though.
maybe something with a directional brace, something like {{ maybe? }}
